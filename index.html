    <p>The Carpathian Mountains or Carpathians (/kɑːrˈpeɪθiənz/) are a mountain range system forming an arc roughly 1,500 km (932 mi) long across Central and Eastern Europe, making them the second-longest mountain range in Europe (after the Scandinavian Mountains, 1,700 km (1,056 mi)).<br><br>

They provide the habitat for the largest European populations of brown bears, wolves, chamois and lynxes, with the highest concentration in Romania,[4][5][6] as well as over one third of all European plant species.[7] The Carpathians and their foothills  also have many thermal and mineral waters, with Romania having one-third of the European total.[8][9] Romania is likewise home to the second largest surface of virgin forests in Europe after Russia, totaling 250,000 hectares (65%), most of them in the Carpathians,[10] with the Southern Carpathians constituting Europe's largest unfragmented forested area.[11]<br><br>

The Carpathians consist of a chain of mountain ranges that stretch in an arc from the Czech Republic (3%) in the northwest through Slovakia (17%), Poland (10%), Hungary  (4%) and Ukraine (11%) to Romania (51%) and Serbia (2%).[1][2][3][12] The highest range within the Carpathians is the Tatras, on the border of Slovakia and Poland, where the highest peaks exceed 2,600 m (8,530 ft). The second-highest range is the Southern Carpathians in Romania, where the highest peaks exceed 2,500 m (8,202 ft).</p>
